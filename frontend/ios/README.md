# How to build

Initially, you need to run the commands below.

```
cd frontend/ios
make init
```

*If you haven't installed Android SDK, then you need to get it. Please visit https://developer.android.com/studio/ and download it. The easist way to install Android Sdk is to install AndroidStudio.*

Please make sure `./gradlew :frontend:ios-combined:packForXCode -PXCODE_CONFIGURATION=Debug` is successfuly run. 

After that, you can open `DroidKaigi 2019.xcworkspace` in Xcode.

## Trouble shooting

## The error shows *SDK location not found.*

You need to tell Gradle the Android sdk location by the environment vairable *ANDROID_HOME* or *local.properties* file.

We strongly recommend you to open the root project on AndroidStudio once. AndroidStudio will generate the suitable local.properties automatically.

> *local.properties* is automatically generated by AndroidStudio but its format may be changed in future. So we should not create/modify *local.properties* manually. AndroidStudio might edit it so your build environment would be broken suddenly.

If you would like to select the *ANDROID_HOME* variable way, you may be able to use `$HOME/Library/Android/sdk` as the sdk location. It is the default location of Android SDK if you manage sdk by AndroidStudio. Otherwise, it depends on your environment.

## No such module xxxxxxx

Please open `DroidKaigi 2019.xcworkspace` instead of `DroidKaigi 2019.xcodeproj` in Xcode.

## java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: org/jetbrains/kotlin/lexer/KotlinLexer

Maybe you use an older version of JDK. [Update JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) on your computer and try building again.
